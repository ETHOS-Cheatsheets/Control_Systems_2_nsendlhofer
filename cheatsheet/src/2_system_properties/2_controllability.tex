\subsection{Controllability}
    A system is controllable if, for any initial condition $x_0$, there exists a control input $u$ that brings the state $x$ to $0$ in finite time.

    For CT Systems: Controllability = Reachability

    For DT Systems: A is invertible $\Rightarrow$ Controllability = Reachability
